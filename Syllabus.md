Management of Digital Research Data
===================================

Syllabus, FS 2015
-----------------

### Course Instructor

Prof. Dr. Tara L Andrews, Unitobler D306 (Muesmattstrasse entrance)  
Office hours: Monday and Wednesday, 2:00–3:00pm; and by appointment.

### When and Where

Monday, 10:15am–11:45am; Hörraum F002, Unitobler, Lerchenweg 36

### Course Evaluation 

Course evaluation will be a combination of participation (30%), homework
assignments (30%), and the take-home final exam (40%).

### Class Participation

Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on
exercises led by the instructor. **BRING YOUR LAPTOP!** We will
accommodate whatever OS you use, but it should be a laptop rather than a
tablet. We will run a post-it note system in the class. If you get
stuck, you put a post-it note on your laptop. If you have finished an
exercise, you should look around for post-it notes and try to help
whoever is stuck. You get a participation point for asking for help
(putting up a Post-it note) as well as for trying to help someone who is
stuck!

### Homework

Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to
learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment,
you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together, then
along with your homework please include a brief note (just a sentence or
two) to indicate who did what.

### Final exam

You will receive a take-home final exam on the 18^th^ of May, to be
completed by the 25^th^, in which you will apply the principles we have
learned to a few research data scenarios.
